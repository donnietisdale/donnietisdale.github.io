There are two sides to every coin.
I kinda give a damn, but I kinda don't care.
A testament to who I once was, and a statement on who I am no longer.
What is right cannot be done too soon.
No matter what you do, someone will always have something to say, so why fear taking action? Do what's right for YOU, and stop living by other people's opinions!
